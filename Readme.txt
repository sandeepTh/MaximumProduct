Write a function that takes a positive integer, N,
and returns the maximal product of a set of positive integers whose sum is N.
Invalid inputs should return 0, that is non-positive integers or any integer where no set of at least 2 positive addends exists.
For example: Given 8, the result is 18
8 can be written as 2*2*2*2 whose product is 16. However, it can also be written as 3*3*2 whose product is 18.
